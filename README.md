# Cinema Reservation

Description

Our project is a web application for cinema ticket reservations. The platform allows users to select their preferred day and time slot. Based on this selection, the application displays the movie scheduled for that time or the closest available one. Subsequently, once the user confirms the movie, they can choose their preferred seat within the theater.
The objective of the web application, and why we choose it, is to to provide a unique approach to the user experience when selecting a movie to watch at the cinema. Unlike traditional methods, this system does not focus on movie selection but rather on the user's availability and time preferences, offering a fresh and innovative alternative.
