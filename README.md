What Your Project Is
Our project is a web application for cinema ticket reservations. The platform allows users to select their preferred day and time slot. Based on this selection, the application displays the movie scheduled for that time or the closest available one. Subsequently, once the user confirms the movie, they can choose their preferred seat within the theater.
The objective of the web application is to streamline the process of movie selection by focusing on the user's availability. It prioritizes scheduling convenience over direct movie selection, ensuring an efficient and user-centric booking experience.
We chose this project because we wanted to provide a unique approach to the user experience when selecting a movie to watch at the cinema. Unlike traditional methods, this system does not focus on movie selection but rather on the user's availability and time preferences, offering a fresh and innovative alternative.
